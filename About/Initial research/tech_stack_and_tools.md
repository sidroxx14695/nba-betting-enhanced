## Infrastructure Setup

### Development Environment

- Local development using VS Code
- GitHub repository for version control
- Continuous integration with GitHub Actions (free)

### Deployment Pipeline

1. Frontend: GitHub → Netlify (automatic deployment)
2. Backend: GitHub → Render (automatic deployment)
3. Database: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted)

### Hosting Configuration

- Frontend: Netlify (free tier - 100GB bandwidth/month)
- Backend API: Render (free tier - 750 hours/month)
- Database: MongoDB Atlas (free tier - 512MB storage)
- Data Processing: Scheduled Python scripts on Render

## Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Serverless Architecture**: Using serverless functions where possible to minimize hosting costs
2. **Efficient Data Storage**: Storing only essential data and using efficient schemas
3. **Caching**: Implementing aggressive caching to reduce API calls
4. **Free Tiers**: Maximizing use of free tiers across all services
5. **Static Generation**: Using static site generation where possible to reduce server load
6. **Batch Processing**: Running prediction models in batches rather than on-demand

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Environment Setup
- Set up GitHub repository
- Configure development environments
- Initialize project structure
- Set up deployment pipelines

### Week 2: Data Layer Implementation
- Establish connections to data APIs
- Create data processing scripts
- Set up database schema
- Implement data caching strategy

### Week 3-4: Backend Development
- Build API endpoints
- Implement authentication
- Create prediction model integration
- Develop parlay calculation logic

### Week 5-6: Frontend Development

- Refine UI/UX
- Deploy MVP

## Scalability Considerations

While our initial MVP will be built with budget constraints, we're selecting technologies that will allow for future scaling:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Both MongoDB Atlas and Render support scaling as needs grow
2. **Modular Architecture**: Separating frontend, backend, and data processing for independent scaling
3. **API-First Design**: Building a robust API that can support future mobile applications
4. **Cloud-Native**: Using cloud services that offer upgrade paths as the application grows

## Conclusion

This technology stack provides a balanced approach to building our NBA Predictive Betting Model MVP within budget constraints. By leveraging free and open-source technologies, along with strategic use of paid services where necessary, we can deliver a functional, visually appealing product while maintaining flexibility for future growth.
