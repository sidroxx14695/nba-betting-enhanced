# NBA Predictive Betting Model MVP - Scope and Architecture

## MVP Overview

We're creating a streamlined predictive betting platform focused exclusively on NBA games with an emphasis on parlays. The platform will provide users with data-driven predictions to help inform their betting decisions, presented through a visually appealing, user-friendly interface.

## Budget Constraints

Total budget: Under $1,000
- Development tools and infrastructure: $300-400
- Data access: $300-400
- Design assets: $100-200
- Miscellaneous/contingency: $100

## Core MVP Features

### 1. NBA Game Predictions
- Win/loss predictions for upcoming NBA games
- Point spread predictions
- Over/under predictions for total points
- Key player performance predictions (points, rebounds, assists)

### 2. Parlay Focus
- Parlay builder tool with prediction integration
- Parlay success probability calculator
- Suggested parlays based on model confidence

### 3. User Interface
- Clean, modern, visually appealing design
- Mobile-responsive web application
- Simple user registration and preferences
- Dashboard with upcoming games and predictions
- Parlay building interface

### 4. Data Visualization
- Visual representation of prediction confidence
- Historical accuracy tracking
- Basic team and player statistics visualization

## Features NOT Included in MVP
- Real-time in-game predictions
- Advanced user profiles and social features
- Multiple sports coverage
- Betting placement functionality (legal considerations)
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile apps (will be web-based only)
- Payment processing

### Components

#### 1. Data Layer
- NBA statistics API integration
- Data storage (lightweight database)
- Data processing scripts
- Historical performance data (limited scope)

#### 2. Prediction Model
- Basic statistical model for game outcomes
- Simple machine learning model for player performance
- Parlay probability calculator
- Model accuracy tracking

#### 3. Backend API
- Game data endpoints
- Prediction endpoints
- User management (basic)
- Configuration management

#### 4. Frontend Application
- Responsive web interface
- Game display components
- Prediction visualization
- Parlay builder interface
- User authentication

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Set up development environment
- Establish data sources and collection process
- Create basic database schema
- Implement simple statistical prediction model

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Weeks 3-4)
- Develop backend API
- Create frontend framework
- Implement user authentication
- Build basic prediction display

### Phase 3: Parlay Features (Weeks 5-6)
- Develop parlay builder interface
- Implement parlay probability calculations
- Create suggested parlays feature

### Phase 4: UI Enhancement and Testing (Weeks 7-8)
- Refine visual design
- Implement data visualizations
- Conduct user testing
- Optimize performance

## Data Requirements

### Essential Data Points
- NBA game schedule
- Team statistics (offensive/defensive ratings, pace, etc.)
- Basic player statistics (points, rebounds, assists per game)
- Historical game results (last 1-2 seasons)
- Betting odds data (for validation)

### Data Update Frequency
- Daily updates for upcoming games
- Post-game updates for model validation

## Technical Constraints

Given our budget limitations, we'll need to:
- Use free/low-cost cloud services with free tiers
- Leverage open-source technologies
- Implement efficient data storage to minimize costs
- Focus on a lightweight architecture that can scale later
- Use public APIs where possible, with fallback scraping when necessary

## Success Metrics

The MVP will be considered successful if it:
1. Provides predictions for all NBA games
2. Achieves prediction accuracy better than random chance
3. Offers functional parlay building capabilities
4. Delivers a visually appealing user experience
5. Operates within our budget constraints
6. Establishes a foundation for future enhancements

## Future Expansion Considerations

While not part of the MVP, the architecture will be designed to eventually support:
- Additional sports beyond NBA
- Real-time data processing
- More sophisticated prediction models
- Mobile applications
- Social features and community
- Monetization options
